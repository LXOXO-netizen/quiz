# openSUSE-quiz

A goal of this project is to provide openSUSE booth staff with a local instance of a quiz that we used to do in [a paper form](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/quizzes). This saves both money and environment.

## Key goals

[x] **Knowledge challenge**m ode where ve value individuals knowledge about the project and we pick the ultimate winner based on stats.

[x] **Getting familiar with openSUSE** mode, where we keep track of attendees and provide a mini interactive (press enter) lottery at the end. So everybody can win some prices.
